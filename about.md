- I'm a DPhil student in machine learning at Oxford, working on theoretical questions in deep learning
- I'm part of the [Autonomous Intelligent Machines and Systems CDT](http://aims.robots.ox.ac.uk/)
- My background is in mathematics and theoretical physics

I did my undergrad and masters at Cambridge in mathematics with astrophysics. 
In between leaving Cambridge and coming to Oxford I spent some years working as a
quant in a hedge fund, designing and building systematic trading strategies.
