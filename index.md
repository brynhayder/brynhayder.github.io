I am a Machine Learning Researcher at [Fundamental](https://fundamental.tech/), building foundation
models for tabular data. I joined as an early member of the research team.

My academic interests focussed around theoretical aspects of statistical machine
learning, symmetry, deep learning and applications of machine learning to science.

You can pronounce my first name as "hi-der" and my surname as "el ess-edy".

### Background
During 2023-2024 I worked as a Senior Machine Learning Researcher at Samsung researching LLM safety and differentially private, federated estimation.

I was a DPhil student in machine learning at Oxford, supervised by 
[Varun Kanade](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/varun.kanade/myindex.html) 
and [Yee Whye Teh](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/). My thesis is [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03858).
<!--I'm also part of the [Autonomous Intelligent Machines and Systems CDT](http://aims.robots.ox.ac.uk/).-->

I spent August-December 2022 at [DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com/) working on [U-Clip](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02971),
supervised by [Marcus Hutter](http://www.hutter1.net/).

I spent the second half of 2021 year doing AI research at [X](https://x.company/)
(formerly Google [x]) supervised by [David Duvenaud](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~duvenaud/). I worked on the early stages of [A-Life](https://x.company/projects/a-life/).

In 2020 I was part of the 
[Royal Society's DELVE initiative](https://rs-delve.github.io/).
This is a multidisciplinary group formed in response to the coronavirus pandemic.
Our results informed policy decisions at the highest level of UK government.

Before my PhD I was a quant at [Tudor](https://www.tudor.com/), and before that I studied maths and theoretical physics at Cambridge
where I was very fortunate to be taught by [Stephen Siklos](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/features/stephen-siklos-1950-2019).

I was not a normal Cambridge applicant.
Over the years I've helped a few others bridge the gap. 
If you want help, send me an email.
