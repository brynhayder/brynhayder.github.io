I work as a Senior Machine Learning Researcher at Samsung, on privacy, federated learning and (soon) LLMs.

I was a DPhil student in machine learning at Oxford, supervised by 
[Varun Kanade](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/varun.kanade/myindex.html) 
and [Yee Whye Teh](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/).
I'm broadly interested in theoretical aspects of statistical machine learning, deep learning
and applications of machine learning to science.
<!--I'm also part of the [Autonomous Intelligent Machines and Systems CDT](http://aims.robots.ox.ac.uk/).-->

I spent August-December 2022 at [DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com/) working on [U-Clip](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02971),
supervised by [Marcus Hutter](http://www.hutter1.net/).

I spent the second half of 2021 year doing AI research at [X](https://x.company/)
(formerly Google [x]) supervised by [David Duvenaud](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~duvenaud/).

In 2020 I was part of the 
[Royal Society's DELVE initiative](https://rs-delve.github.io/).
This is a multidisciplinary group formed in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

Before my PhD I was a quant at [Tudor](https://www.tudor.com/), and before that I studied maths and theoretical physics at Cambridge
where I was fortunate to be taught by [Stephen Siklos](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/features/stephen-siklos-1950-2019).

I was not a normal Cambridge applicant.
Over the years I've helped a few others bridge the gap. 
If you want help, send me an email.
