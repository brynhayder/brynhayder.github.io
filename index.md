I'm a DPhil student in machine learning at Oxford, supervised by 
[Varun Kanade](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/varun.kanade/myindex.html) and [Yee Whye Teh](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/).
<!--I'm also part of the [Autonomous Intelligent Machines and Systems CDT](http://aims.robots.ox.ac.uk/).-->

I research theoretical issues in statistical machine learning.
My focus is currently on generalisation in overparameterised models and the implications of symmetry.

I am part of the [Royal Society's DELVE initiative](https://rs-delve.github.io/) as a member of the action team.
This is a multidisciplinary group formed in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

Previously I studied maths and theoretical physics at Cambridge
and worked on systematic trading strategies at a hedge fund.
