I'm a DPhil student in machine learning at Oxford, supervised by 
[Varun Kanade](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/varun.kanade/myindex.html) and [Yee Whye Teh](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/).
<!--I'm also part of the [Autonomous Intelligent Machines and Systems CDT](http://aims.robots.ox.ac.uk/).-->

I research theoretical aspects of statistical machine learning.
My focus is currently on generalisation in overparameterised models and the implications of symmetry.

I'm spending the second half of this year doing AI research at [X](https://x.company/)
(formerly known as Google X).

In 2020 I became part of the 
[Royal Society's DELVE initiative](https://rs-delve.github.io/).
This is a multidisciplinary group formed in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

Before my PhD I worked on systematic trading strategies at a hedge fund
and before that I studied maths and theoretical physics at Cambridge.

I was not a normal Cambridge applicant.
Over the years I've helped a few others bridge the gap. 
If you need help and you want to chat, send me an email.
